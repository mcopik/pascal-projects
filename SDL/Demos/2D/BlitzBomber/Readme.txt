A game written by KiCHY dESiGN.

This game is completely FREE. I except no responsibility for any damage
caused by using this programme.

-+= Description =+-----------------------------------------------------

This program is a very simple game.
You must destroy all skyscrapers to land safely. You can destroy these
buildings with your bomb. You can drop a bomb with SPACE key. You can't
drop another bomb until the previous bomb was destroyed. A bomb can't
destroy a whole building just the upper 10 levels including roofs, etc.

When you safely landed you completed the game. It's not so easy as you
think!
