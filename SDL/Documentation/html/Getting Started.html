<h3>Setting up Delphi or Kylix to work with JEDI-SDL</h3>
      <br>
           
<div align="left">      
<ol>
        <li>Extract the JEDI-SDL Zip file or Tar.gz file, to a directory
of  your  choice,&nbsp; making sure you maintain the archives built in directory 
 structure.  For example I have a "headers" directory under my Delphi or Kylix
 installation  directory. So for me on a windows machine I have installed 
JEDI-SDL to. "D:\Program  Files\Borland\Delphi6\Headers\JEDI-SDL\.....". Make
sure you remember this  path &nbsp;and also that under Linux, paths are case
sensitive so you may  want to keep everything in lower case. The main advantage
of extracting them  under your installed Delphi or Kylix directory is so
you can make use of the $(DELPHI) path directive as shown in the next few
steps</li>
      <li>Next we need to make sure we are using the latest Runtimes for
out   system. in the ....\JEDI-SDL\Runtimes\ directory you will find the
latest   Linux ( in RPM format ) and and Windows ( DLLs ) runtimes.</li>
               
  <ul>
        <li>Under Linux install each RPM and everything should be ready to
 go  on to Step 3.</li>
           
    <ul>
        <li>NOTE : For the DeathTruckTion game to run you must have either
 fmod.dll ( under Windows ) or<br>
  libfmod-3.5.so ( under Linux ) installed.<br>
  Under Linux, make sure you are logged in as <b>root</b> and copy the libfmod-3.5.so<br>
file from the Runtimes/Linux/ directory to your /usr/lib/ directory. You
also need to ensure that the shared library has the correct permissions,
 other wise it will not execute correctly. So via a command line, navigate
to the /usr/lib/ directory and enter the following command ( it assumed you
are in /usr/lib/ and logged in as <b>root</b> )...<br>
          <b>chmod 755 libfmod-3.5.so</b>.<br>
Now you need to create a symbolic link between libfmod-3.5.so and libfmod.so.
This is done with the<br>
  following command ( it assumed you are in /usr/lib/ and logged in as <b>root</b>
)...<br>
          <b>ln -s libfmod-3.5.so libfmod.so</b>.</li>
        <li>Similarly, I found that the smpeg RPM did not install smpeg correctly.
 In you /usr/lib/ directory you will probably find libsmpeg-0.4.so. This
is fine but the smpeg file now refers to the Linux norm of a generic symbolic
 link. So we will have to create one. Via a command line, navigate to the
/usr/lib/ directory and create a symbolic link between&nbsp;libsmpeg-0.4.so
and libsmpeg.so. This is done with the<br>
   following command ( it assumed you are in /usr/lib/ and logged in as <b>root</b>
)...<br>
          <b> ln -s&nbsp;libsmpeg-0.4.so libsmpeg.so</b>.<br>
        </li>
           
    </ul>
        <li>Under Windows, unzip and copy each DLL to your ...\System or
...\System32   directory and everything should be ready to go on to Step
3.<br>
        </li>
               
  </ul>
        <li>Now that you have the all the header files, associated demos
and   runtimes in  their logical places, open up Delphi or Kylix and go to..</li>
     
</ol>
     
<blockquote>         
  <ul>
       <li>&nbsp;the "Environment Options"  menu option,&nbsp;<img

 height="112">
       </li>
       <li>then select the "Library" tab and then click on the ellipses 
(  the button with 3 dots on it ) that are associated with "Library Path".<img

       </li>
           
  </ul>
   </blockquote>
     
<ol>
        <li>Assuming you have extracted the files to the directory I suggested 
  above, you can simply add the following entries to the "Directories" dialog...</li>
           
</ol>
           
<blockquote>                  
  <ul>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL_Mixer/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL_Image/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL_Net/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL_ttf/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/smpeg/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SFont/Pas</li>
          <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDL_Sound/Pas</li>
     <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDLMonoFonts/Pas</li>
     <li>$(DELPHI)/Headers/JEDI-SDL/SDLSpriteEngine/Pas<br>
     </li>
                       
  </ul>
      </blockquote>
   After the above changes you should have something that looks similar to
 this ( Remember if you are using Linux you should use "/" and not "\" for
 you paths. Windows allows you to use both it you like. )...<br>

   &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
   Once these paths are entered and you have clicked ok for Delphi  or Kylix 
 to store the path information in its registry, you should be ready  to start 
 coding or to start playing with around with the demos.<br>

 hopes   your experience is a positive one.<br>
