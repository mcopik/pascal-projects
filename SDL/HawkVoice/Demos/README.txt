JEDI-SDL Hawk Voice Demo
------------------------

This application demostrates using the Hawk Voice DLL to compress and decompress 
voice data. The dll provided is slighly modified to export non mangled names from 
Visual C+. The .def file provied with the demo is the file needed to unmangle the 
names so it can be used with the pascal interface unit.
