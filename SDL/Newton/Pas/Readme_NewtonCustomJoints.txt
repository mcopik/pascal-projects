About :
==============================================================================================
The file "NewtonCustomJoints.pas" contains the current translation of the custom joints that
are included in the Newton SDK. Those are joints recreated using Newton's custom joint interface and which can be changed to suit your needs, or you can create your own joints.
Use the class "TNewtonCustomBaseJoint" as a base for creating new joints.


Where to get :
==============================================================================================
The current version of this header can always be downloaded at http://newton.delphigl.de
It's usually udpated when the SDK itself is updated, but there may also be some out-of-order
updates in case there are errors/problems with the header translation.
